The AI engineer's work began with a broad interpretation of a FICA reduction program, leading to a full-stack React/FastAPI/MongoDB application. A major re-pivot occurred when the user clarified they only wanted a simple redirect. This quickly evolved into a lead capture system, integrating flyer content, a backend for lead storage, an admin dashboard for tracking, and a marketing hub. The core technical challenges involved adapting the initial complex application into a simpler, focused lead generation tool, handling API contracts, frontend state, and later, debugging domain and timezone issues. The engineer meticulously addressed each user request incrementally, from backend data models and API endpoints to complex frontend UI components, always testing thoroughly after each significant change. The most persistent challenge has been the custom domain DNS propagation and accessibility, which remains unresolved at the end of the trajectory, alongside ensuring the PIN protection for the admin panel is live.

The user initially requested an application for a FICA reduction program for business owners, offering employee health benefits and permanent life insurance, providing a link  for more information. This was broadly interpreted by the AI engineer as a full-fledged application including business owner registration, employee benefit enrollment, real-time FICA savings calculation, eligibility verification, and a self-service enrollment system.

However, the user later clarified that the core requirement was simply to direct traffic to their provided URL . This was refined to integrate the two, meaning a professional landing page showcasing FICA benefits (from a provided flyer template) that *also* directs users to . The final and current requirement evolved into a lead capture application that uses the flyer content, collects business owner information (name, email, phone, business name, industry, employee count) through a modal form, saves this data to a database, and *then* redirects them to .

Additional features requested include:
- A way to get the message out there, which led to the creation of a comprehensive marketing system (email templates, social media posts, phone scripts, etc.).
- A way to see the tracking, resulting in an admin dashboard to view captured leads and analytics.
- Adjustment of timestamps in the dashboard to EST (later corrected to EDT/EST dynamic detection).
- Access control for the admin dashboard via a 4-digit PIN (initially 1234, updated to 2017).

<current_work>
The AI engineer has built a complete FICA Reduction Program lead capture system. This system consists of:
1.  **A Professional Landing Page**: Located at  (intended URL), it displays benefits derived from the user's provided flyer template.
2.  **Lead Capture Form**: A modal form pops up when a user clicks Apply Now or Get Your Free Quote, collecting business owner details (name, email, phone, business name, industry, employee count).
3.  **Backend Lead Storage**: The collected lead data is saved to a MongoDB database via a FastAPI endpoint.
4.  **Automatic Redirect**: After form submission, the user is redirected to the external URL .
5.  **Admin Dashboard**: Accessible at , it displays captured leads in real-time, shows aggregate statistics (total leads, by industry/employee count), calculates potential FICA savings per lead, and allows for CSV export. Timestamps on the dashboard are converted to Eastern Time (EST/EDT).
6.  **Marketing Hub**: Accessible at , it provides a repository of ready-to-use marketing materials, including email templates, social media posts, and phone scripts, based on the user's all the above request for promotion.
7.  **PIN Protection**: A 4-digit PIN (set to 2017) has been implemented to secure the  dashboard, preventing unauthorized access.

Currently, the application is deployed and verified on the Emergent platform, and the custom domain  has been successfully linked and verified. However, the user reports that the domain is still unreachable (). The AI engineer is actively troubleshooting this connectivity issue. Additionally, the user has not yet confirmed if the PIN protection for the admin dashboard is live on the deployed application, which likely requires a redeploy to take effect on the live URL. The last exchange focused on diagnosing why the custom domain is not resolving correctly and the AI engineer has asked for specific error messages and network checks.
